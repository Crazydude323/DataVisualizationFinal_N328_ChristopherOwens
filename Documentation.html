    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <p>Hoo boy, where do I even begin... For starters, I'll just say that I know the visualization itself is pretty awful. I wish that I had some grand excuse for that, but I honestly don't - I'm just really, really bad at HTML. And D3, apparently. I at least managed to get it sort of interactive, so... better than nothing? And I managed to import the whole CSV file, that part's all functional! But try as I might, there were a number of things I just couldn't get working. Case in point, I tried a whole slew of variations of parseInt() to turn strings into actual numbers, so that I could use that for the height interval of the chart, but no dice. As I've said, no excuses - I just really suck at this... I'm not sure if D3 counts as its own language, but I know I'm bad with it.</p>
    <p>Well, as for the INTENDED design of the visualization, and a little bit of the actual design (and lack of functionality). The original intention was to showcase world population of various countries, and by clicking on bars, they would disappear. The graph would then shrink to fit the bars that were left - closing in from the sides, and the y scale (population number) shrinking down. It was also meant to give you a little tool-tip if you hovered over a bar, telling you the exact number and country. It does change color if you hover over it, but... I tried a few different methods to try and pull the country name out of the bar, but I don't think it's even being stored from what I could tell when I was in the Inspector. So that plan obviously fell through. And while I was able to get the bars to delete when you clicked on them, the graph wouldn't shrink down, which sort of defeats the purpose. It's technically interactive, and the data is all there, but man am I not sure how to maneuver it properly. Many of the actual design details were hammered out real quick, though.</p>
    <p>I chose a bar chart for simple reasons - I just like bar charts. I think they're easy to digest, and work well for almost every kind of data. Colors were also easy enough; blue and orange are opposites on the color wheel, so it makes the bars "pop" when you mouse over them. I considered a few other color combinations, but I wanted the default color to be something darker, and that shrunk my options pretty fast. As for some of the other, unimplemented design choices that I mentioned in the last paragraph; I thought that the chart shrinking down was an interesting idea to dynamically show which countries are highly populated. The top 5 or so aren't terribly surprising, but after that it can actually catch you off guard how populated some of those nations are. I figured people would naturally want to click on the biggest bars first, and as the graph shrunk you'd see that some nations are way more populated than you'd expect. It also, at least on paper, makes the chart fun to interact with - like popping bubble wrap. If it actually worked, mind you. It also helps that by default the chart is massive, just because there are so many countries on it. So as it shrunk, you'd actually be able to tell as the scroll bars on the side and bottom of your screen got smaller and smaller.</p>
    <p>I don't have screenshots, because, well... there just isn't much on the visualization to take screenshots of, now is there? But the actual process of making it still helped answer a few questions and discover a few things. I already mentioned that there are some nations that are way more populated than you think, but really it's more like EVERY nation is more populated than you'd think. 7 billion humans is a really big number, and it's easy to forget that there's that many of us when you don't have the info right in front of you. And then, you see that pretty much every nation is in the multi-millions, population wise. It's wild to think about. I don't know if the visualization was ever going to show more than that, even if I had completed it flawlessly, but then it was meant to be a simple and fun thing. As I said earlier, bubble wrap.</p>

    <h4>Personal Note</h4>
    <p>I was already pretty open during the main body of text, so I'll be brief here. I just want to:</p>
    <p>1: Apologize. I don't think I was ever going to have a fantastic final project, I'm just not good enough at HTML and this sort of thing. But this, certainly, is pretty darn bad for a final project.</p>
    <p>2: Pray that this is at least good enough to pass, if only just. This one's more for myself than for you, but you know what they say - it's good to get these sorts of thoughts out of your head and into the open. Therapeutic or something. I did meet the requirements of pulling data from a CSV and building a graph from it, having the graph respond to interaction, and all the extraneous stuff. So... maybe it's not as bad as I'm thinking. Again, thoughts for me more than you.</p>
